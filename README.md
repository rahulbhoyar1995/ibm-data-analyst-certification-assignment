## Description

This repository showcases my work and accomplishments during the IBM Data Analyst Certification program. The assignments cover various data analysis topics, methodologies, and tools, highlighting my proficiency in data manipulation, visualization, and interpretation.

## Contents

- **Assignment 1**:   Extracting essential data from a dataset and displaying it is a necessary part of data science; therefore individuals can make correct decisions based on the data. In this assignment, you will extract some stock data, you will then display this data in a graph.
- **Assignment 2**:

A company's stock share is a piece of the company more precisely:

A stock (also known as equity) is a security that represents the ownership of a fraction of a corporation. This

entitles the owner of the stock to a proportion of the corporation's assets and profits equal to how much stock they own. Units of stock are called "shares."

An investor can buy a stock and sell it later. If the stock price increases, the investor profits, If it decreases,the investor with incur a loss.  Determining the stock price is complex; it depends on the number of outstanding shares, the size of the company's future profits, and much more. People trade stocks throughout the day the stock ticker is a report of the price of a certain stock, updated continuously throughout the trading session by the various stock market exchanges.** **

You are a data scientist working for a hedge fund; it's your job to determine any suspicious stock activity. In this lab you will extract stock data using a Python library. We will use the yfinance**  **library, it allows us to extract data for stocks returning data in a pandas dataframe. You will use the lab to extract.
